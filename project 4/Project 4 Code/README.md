# Introduction 
**In this project, you will use Stacks and Queues to solve basic mazes. 
A maze is a network of paths designed so there is at least one path from the entrance of the maze 
to the exit of the maze. You will be using a queue structure to find this correct path through the maze, 
and a stack structure to randomly generate new mazes.**
