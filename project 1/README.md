# Parts of this Problem
## Problem 1 (Random Numbers)
###### **In this part of the problem, an instantiable Random class has been programmed for generating random numbers. The methods which have been created in the Random class include:**
1. public Random(int p1, int p2, int m): Set up a random number generator with the given constants. 
2. public void setSeed(int seed): Set the seed of the random number generator.
3. public int getMaximum(): Return the value of M for this random number generator.
4. public int random(): Use the sequential random number algorithm to generate the rnew value and return it. 
5. public int randomInteger(int lower, int upper): Return a random integer in the range lower to upper.
6. public boolean randomBoolean(): Randomly return true or false. This should simulate a 50% chance.
7. public double randomDouble(double lower, double upper): Get a random double in the range lower to upper.
8. A main method: The main method should demonstrate sufficient testing to prove that each of the methods work.
